What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- does not create a commit
	- creates a .git file in the folder and takes note of the files in the directory
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- the staging area contains the files you intend to add to the repository
	- this allows you to choose which files you want to commit and in what order
